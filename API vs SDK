API(Application Programming Interface) and SDK(Software Devepoment Kit) are essential tools in the software development world, but they serve distinct purpose.

API:
An API is an is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications and services to communcation with each other.
-> It defines how software components should intract.
-> Facilitates data exchange and functionality access between software components.
-> Typically consits of endpoints, requets and responses.[Endpoints, Requests, Response, Parameters]

SDK:
An SDK is a comprehensive package of tools, libraries, sample code, and documetation that assist developers in building application for a particular platforms, frameworks, or hard ware.
-> Offers higher-level abstrations, simplifying development for a specific platform.
-> Tailored to specific platforms or frameworks, ensuring compatibility and optional performance on that platform.
-> Offer access to advance features and compatibilites specific to the platform, which be otherwise challenging to implement from scratch.


** SDk's are preferred choice when building applications that integrate with a specific platform/technology. While APIs are more appropriate for extrating data or performing operation from a specific platform/technology.
