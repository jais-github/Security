Authentication in REST APIs acts as the crucial gateway, ensuring that solely authorized users or applications gain access to the API's resources.

Some popular authentication methods for REST APIs include:

1. Basic Authentication: Involves sending a username and password with each request, but can be less secure without encryption.
   When to use: Suitable for simple applications where security and encryption arenâ€™t the primary concern or when used over secured connections.

  Client        Server
--------        ------
| User |  -->  |    |
--------       ------
| Pass |  -->  |    |
--------       ------
  Request       Verify

2.Token Authentication: Uses generated tokens, like JSON Web Tokens (JWT), exchanged between client and server, offering enhanced security without sending login credentials with each request.
  When to use: Ideal for more secure and scalable systems, especially when avoiding sending login credentials with each request is a priority.

   Client         Server
----------       ------
| Token  |  -->  |    |
----------       ------
   Request       Verify

3. OAuth Authentication: Enables third-party limited access to user resources without revealing credentials by issuing access tokens after user authentication.
  When to use: Ideal for scenarios requiring controlled access to user resources by third-party applications or services.

   User           Server            Third-Party App
----------       ------            ---------------
| Auth |  -->  |      |  <--  |   Authorization  |
----------       ------       ------------------
|Grant |  <--  |      |  -->  |   Access Token   |
----------       ------       ------------------
   User            Grant           Access Token
  Authorization

4. API Key Authentication: Assigns unique keys to users or applications, sent in headers or parameters; while simple, it might lack the security features of token-based or OAuth methods.
  When to use: Convenient for straightforward access control in less sensitive environments or for granting access to certain functionalities without the need for user-specific permissions.

   Client        Server
----------      ------
| API Key |  --> |    |
----------      ------
   Request       Verify
