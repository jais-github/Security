1. what are microservices?
-> Microservices are a way of designing software applications as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. 
Instead of building a monolithic application where all functions are tightly integrated, microservices break down the application into smaller,
specialized services, each responsible for specific functions or features.

These services communicate with each other typically through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).
Each service operates independently and can be developed, deployed, and scaled separately. This approach offers several advantages, including:

Scalability: Services can be scaled individually based on demand, allowing for better resource utilization.
Flexibility and Agility: Developers can work on different services simultaneously, enabling faster development and updates.
Resilience: If one service fails, it doesn't necessarily affect the entire system, as other services can continue to function.
Technology Diversity: Different services can be built using different technologies, allowing teams to choose the best tools for each specific task.
Easy Maintenance and Upgrades: Updating or making changes to one service doesn't require modifying the entire application.
